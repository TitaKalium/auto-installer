# Auto Application Installer
Do you just hate when you get a new pc and you have to go through the pain of installing all of your favourite applications? This program can solve it. 

This script can install all the apps that are necessary for your computer.

If you want to add more applications other than the ones in the script, please email me at idumpedmykidinthedelawareriver@gmail.com (don't bother questioning i made the email as a joke in maths class lol). 

# How to install

In order to install, you have to first get Chocolately setup. You can visit the link https://chocolatey.org/install to install. 

After installing Chocolatey and checking if it works by doing this command,
``` ps1
choco -?
```
run the powershell script in administrative powershell so the applications can install. After the installation has finished downloading, all your applications should be there. 

Also, if you have trouble installing the script, you can use [this](https://techyguide360.com/easy-how-to-enable-running-scripts-in-windows-11/) tool to help with powershell.
